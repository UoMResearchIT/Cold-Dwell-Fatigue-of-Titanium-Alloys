# Cold Dwell Fatigue of Titanium Alloys: History, Current State, and Aviation Industry Perspective [Supporting Software]

This repo is an attempt to Dockerize the package cited below. Changes so far involve porting to a Linux environment, minor bug fixes, linting & cleanup. Eventually it needs a good rewrite, separating the logic from the GUI, and refactoring for readability.

## Microtexture Quantification Workflow
Automated routines were developed by a consortium of aerospace companies under Metals Affordability Initiative (MAI) programs to process and quantify microtexture in titanium. These routines were made available as part of the PW9 program for assessment and publicly released under PW24 program (2024). The tool is not intended to be perfect, but there is concensus among the industry that it appropriate for benchmark comparisons of materials and draw useful correlations for different processing routes, product forms, etc. The tool is provided “as is". Sse the software at your own risk. No warranties are provided as to performance, fitness for a particular purpose not outlined above, or any other warranties whether expressed or implied.

The routines use open-source software Dream3D (version 6.5.49) to perform EBSD file cleanup and feature quantification. Additional post-processing scripts were developed in Python to compute additional metrics and automate data post-processing.
